# Production Line

The Production Line software is a demonstration of higher-level object oriented programming skills that incorporates a database. I made this software independently over the course of four months in 2019. I worked on this product as a junior at Florida Gulf Coast University.

I made this project to not just demonstrate my skill to a wandering prospective, but to sharpen my own proficiency in programming and software engineering so I may share my skills to employers that I find in the real world. I also want to share to everyone that I have the determination and responsibility to learn how to be a better software engineer. 

## Demonstration

## Documentation

Create a docs folder in your project. If using Java, generate JavaDoc in your IDE. If using C++, use Doxygen. Change repository settings (using Settings at top of page) to use GitHub Pages with your docs folder. Add a link to the javadoc/doxygen index.html file with this markdown: \[Text to appear]\(URL) <br />
The URL will be YourGitHubUserName.github.io/YourRepositoryName/foldername/filename<br /> 
Do not include the docs folder name in your URL. <br />
Sample: \[JavaDoc]\(https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html) <br /> <br />
[JavaDoc](https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html)

## Diagrams
