# Production Line

The Production Line software is a demonstration of higher-level object oriented programming skills that incorporates a database. I made this software independently over the course of four months in 2019. I worked on this product as a junior at Florida Gulf Coast University.

I made this project to not just demonstrate my skill to a wandering prospective, but to sharpen my own proficiency in programming and software engineering so I may share my skills to employers that I find in the real world. I also want to share to everyone that I have the determination and responsibility to learn how to be a better software engineer.
